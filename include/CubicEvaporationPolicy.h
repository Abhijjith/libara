/**
* This class provides the cubic evaporation function for an ant routing algorithm.
* The formula has been taken from the Masters Thesis "Optimization and evaluation
* of energy aware ant routing algorithm strategies based on network simulations"
* by Friedrich Gro√üe.
*
* Even though this is called cubic evaporation it will work also with odd exponents greater
* than three.
*
* The general formula is the following:
*
*     f(Tau) = P/(alpha^b) * ( alpha^b + (Tau - alpha)^b )
*
*     Tau = the time since the last traffic has been sent.
*     P = the height of the plateau. This corresponds to the amount of pheromone which will
*         later be subtracted from the last known pheromone value when traffic has been sent
*     alpha = the time since the center of the plateau should be reached
*     b = an odd integer exponent greater than zero
